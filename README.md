We provide a Case Study, as shown in the figure \[casestudy.pdf].



\### Analysis:



> The vector \[1, 0, 1] indicates that only the text rationale and the visual rationale are adopted. While the textual 'I love you' and visual 'wide smile' provide the strongest semantic and emotional evidence respectively, the audio rationale lacks direct emotional indicators. Thus, it offers a limited contribution to sentiment analysis and presents redundant information compared to the other modalities.
